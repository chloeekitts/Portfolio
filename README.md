# Portfolio

This is a website I created to showcase my work in both Web Development and Graphic Design. I wanted to include a short bio about myself and my experience, along with a link to my current resume. This includes an opportunity to contact me for collaboration or employment as well.

I plan to continue adding to this and customizing the design during my Coding Bootcamp. 

Enjoy!
